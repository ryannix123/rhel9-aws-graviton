## **🐳 Why Use Podman for Containerized Applications?**

Podman is a **secure, lightweight, and daemonless** container engine designed for running, managing, and deploying containers. Unlike Docker, it does **not require a background daemon**, making it **more secure and resource-efficient**.

### **🔹 Key Benefits of Using Podman**
✅ **Rootless Security** – Run containers as a non-root user, **reducing attack surfaces** and security risks.  
✅ **Daemonless Architecture** – No always-running service, leading to **lower memory overhead** and fewer attack vectors.  
✅ **Seamless Docker Compatibility** – Use existing **Dockerfiles** and **OCI-compliant** images without modification.  
✅ **Kubernetes-Ready** – Easily generate Kubernetes YAML from running containers, enabling a **smooth transition to Kubernetes**.  
✅ **Enterprise-Grade Performance** – Optimized for **RHEL**, ensuring **stability, security, and reliability**.

By using **Podman on RHEL 9 Graviton**, you get a **lightweight, efficient, and secure** containerized application platform **without extra licensing costs** or unnecessary dependencies.
